#HSK Character Profiler

HSK Character Profiler is a Python command-line tool that provides a way to analyze a text file containing Chinese characters to determine the levels of proficiency in Chinese language skills based on the HSK (Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi) system.

The HSK Character Profiler identifies the HSK level of each character in the text file, and provides a report of the number of characters found at each HSK level, as well as an average HSK level of the text file. The tool also identifies characters that are not included in the HSK system.

The HSK Character Profiler is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing users to modify the input file and the HSK character sets used for analysis.

The tool is written in Python and utilizes popular NLP libraries such as NLTK and Jieba for character segmentation and analysis. The HSK Character Profiler can be useful for Chinese language learners, teachers, and researchers who need to assess the difficulty level of a text or determine the appropriate HSK level for a specific vocabulary list or learning material.
