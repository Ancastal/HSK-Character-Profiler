![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.1.1-blue.svg)

The HSK Character Profiler is a Python command-line tool developed as part of a Master's thesis in Computational Linguistics titled "Evaluating the Effectiveness of Machine Translation for Literary Works: A Comparative Study of English and Chinese Corpora."

## Features

- Analyze Chinese text files to determine HSK proficiency levels
- Color-coded visualization of HSK levels for better readability
- Real-time progress tracking during analysis
- Detailed statistics with sample characters for each HSK level
- Comprehensive summary with key metrics
- Export results to JSON format for further analysis

The tool provides a way to analyze a text file containing Chinese characters and determine the levels of proficiency in Chinese language skills based on the HSK (Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi) system. It identifies the HSK level of each character in the text file and generates a report of the number of characters found at each HSK level, as well as the average HSK level of the text.

## Usage

1. Place your Chinese text in 'characters.txt'
2. Run the program to see detailed HSK analysis
3. Results will be automatically saved in JSON format

The HSK Character Profiler is flexible and customizable, allowing users to modify the input file and the HSK character sets used for analysis. It utilizes popular NLP libraries such as NLTK and Jieba for character segmentation and analysis.

This tool can be particularly useful for Chinese language learners, teachers, and researchers who need to assess the difficulty level of a text or determine the appropriate HSK level for a specific vocabulary list or learning material.
